# SATELLITE IMAGERY CLASSIFICATION
# Project Overview

This project aims to classify satellite images using deep learning models, including a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pretrained VGG16 model. The project uses the EuroSAT dataset, a widely used dataset for satellite imagery classification. It focuses on classifying images into 10 different land use and land cover categories, such as AnnualCrop, Forest, Residential, and SeaLake.
